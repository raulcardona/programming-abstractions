Exercises from the book

As I follow along with Stanford's CS106B class I'm doing all the exercises in the reader:

Programming Abstractions in C++ by Eric S. Roberts.

The first 8 exercises were done in Qt creator.  
I might change them over to xCode projects later for consistancy.
I also plan to add more comments.
