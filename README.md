Exercises from the book

As I follow along with Stanford's CS106B class I'm doing all the exercises in the reader:

Programming Abstractions in C++ by Eric S. Roberts.

I've been using the command line for the majority of the excercises. Graphical programs are built in Xcode and only include source files.  Use the included Xcode blank project to compile these ones.

Example command line build: g++ example.cpp -lStanfordCPPLib -L/Path/to/StanfordCPPLib/ -I/Path/to/StanfordCPPLib/ -o example
